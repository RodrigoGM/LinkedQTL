LinkedQTL
=========

Simulation of two linked QTL in a single chromosome with varying number of markers, QTL location and effect sizes.

* *data/*
	
	Directory contain main simulation data i.e. starting parameters.  These are , the congenic marker maps, QTL effects and distances, and the random number generator's seed.

* *src/*
	
	Source scripts

* *cf2_d/  cf2_e/  cf2_o/  cf2_p/*
	
	Directores specific to the data generated by the simulation.  The letter following the underscore stands for :
	* d = data (unprocessed cross data)
	* e = examples (fully saved subset of crosses and analysis)
	* o = outputs (output QTL summary files)
	* p = processed data (after succesfull analysis, files in cf2_d are moved to cf2_p)
